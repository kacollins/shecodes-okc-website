Today we'll work together to build a dynamic website with [React](https://reactjs.org/). React is a JavaScript library which uses [components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) to make building web apps a breeze. If you aren't familiar with [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [codecademy is a good place to start.](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

Before we get started, we need to make sure we have a few housekeeping things in order first.

### 1. Download an IDE

  An IDE is an "integrated development environment". Basically, this is just a program that we use to write code. If you haven't already installed one, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good choice -- it's free and very easy to use.

### 2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

  Node is a JavaScript runtime that allows JavaScript, a traditionally client-side language, to run on a server. We'll use Node to help serve our web app. If you don't already Node installed, you can [install Node here.](https://nodejs.org/en/) To verify Node is installed, you can open up a terminal and run `node -v`. (If you are on Windows, you might want to download [gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/).) 
  If you get an error that the command doesn't exist, this means Node isn't installed.

### 3. Install [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#create-react-app-)

  Create-React-App is a scaffold that generates a sample React app. There are a lot of files involved with a React app that we don't necessarily want to make by hand, so using Create-React-App makes getting started much easier and much faster.

Now that we have installed a few things, we are ready to get started writing React!
