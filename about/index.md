Looking for a supportive group for learning about tech? Look no further! SheCodesOKC is a group of female technologists coming together each month to learn and support each other. We share new libraries, hardware, and other tech we've come across. We work together to empower women in the OKC tech community, and provide outreach for women learning about and entering the industry. We can't wait to meet you!

Please review our code of conduct (https://www.techlahoma.org/code-of-conduct/) before attending our events.
